				    <p>Taking admission to a University is a very crucial time in a student’s life. It is the time which reflects the hard work one does during their school life, especially in 10 + 1 and 10 + 2. In this blog, I will go a bit off-topic from tech and will be talking about admissions, mostly revolving around admissions in Engineering colleges.
</p><br>

				    
				    <p>For those who don’t know, I am currently a second year Computer Science student at Manipal University Jaipur. Now you might be wondering that how can I give you advice as I study in a college which is not equivalent to or even near to the likes of IITs, IIITs, NITs, BITS etc. Trust me, students like us have more knowledge about different Universities and their admission processes as we did a lot of research about them, since we were not getting admission anywhere.
</p><br>
                    
				
					<p>If you got a rank under 1K in JEE advance, then congrats, you can get a good stream in a reputed IIT. If you got a rank under 10K in JEE mains, then you will be able to get admission in some good colleges and institutions like DTU, IIITs, some good NITs, NSUT etc. By this rank, I mean a good, in demand stream such as CSE, IT. If your rank is in the range of 15K-30K, then also, you will be able to get admission in these colleges in streams such as ECE, EEE, Mechanical etc.
						<p>NOTE: all these figures are for General category only.</p>

</p><br>

					<p>Now, all the students with rank from 30K to 60k can easily get admission in Computer Science in colleges like Jaypee, Thapar etc. These are some Tier 2 universities which can be considered in the given rank range. After 60K, it becomes difficult for a general category student to secure a seat in these colleges in an in-demand stream, whereas in case of students who come under reserved categories, the rank can vary up to 150K for the same seat. Yup, that’s the bitter truth!</p>
<p>
Now for general category, if your rank varies anywhere from 60K to 200K, then Indraprastha University is an available option, especially for Delhi NCR students. Other than JEE, some available options are CBSE marks for Delhi University, BITSAT for BITS, VITEEE for VITs, MET for all universities associated with Manipal group. You need to get at least 330-340 marks in BITSAT to get admission in CSE in one of the BITS institutes. In case of VITEEE, even 20K rank can get you admission in CSE in VIT Vellore (basically money matters, not rank). As for MET, you must have a score of at least 400 out of 800 to get a computer related branch in the South Campus.
</p><br>
                <p>Talking about myself, I got a rank approximately around 130K in Mains. I didn’t qualify for JEE Advance. I got a rank of 19K in VITEEE, scored in 350s in MET with a rank of 6.3K and finally, a score of 183 in BITSAT. Pretty horrible right? I wasn’t able to think what should I do now, where should I take admission. I wanted to take admission in a stream related to Computers only and thus, the best options available with me were VIT, Manipal University Jaipur, IPU and some other private Tier 3 universities like Lovely Professional, Chatkara, Amity, Bennett and so on.</p><br>

                <p>Now, many ask me “why didn’t you take admission in VIT?”, since VIT was the best option available to me according to rankings. There were multiple reasons for this decision, the first one being that there are over 1200 seats just in CSE in VIT. If we include IT then these figures go in the range of 2.5K-3K. with this much intake, which is growing every year rapidly, it becomes difficult for the faculty to look after the academic performance of each student. Secondly, the level of caliber. A student with rank under 5K is studying CSE by paying less fees whereas, another student with a rank of 35K is also studying CSE by paying more fees. Even though both are in CSE, it can be easily judged that the student with a rank under 5K has more potential and thus can easily secure a good placement opportunity. These number of students increases the competition enormously.</p><br>

                <p>Talking about my University, MUJ has the best hostel in India. So, it really gives home like feeling, with some great mess food. There are around 600 seats, CSE, IT and CCE combined, thus, faculty to student ratio is much better. Almost 65% of the faculty has PhD and the remaining 35% are pursuing it currently. Manipal has a great coding culture, even better than some NITs, IIITs. Talking about placements, some big names like Amazon, Microsoft, Dell, HPE, SAP, Goldman Sachs etc., come to offer jobs to our students. For 2019 batch, the average package was 6.2 LPA whereas the highest package was 42 LPA, which was offered by Microsoft.</p><br>

                <p>Whatever University you go into, it hardly makes a difference, what matters is your hard work and dedication to your academics and co curriculars. Just go, make some good and reliable friends, interact with faculty and enjoy this small, fun ride of college life!</p><br>
 
                <p>NOTE: I am not promoting any University via this blog, everything is based on my experience and knowledge.</p>
                   
                <p>Feel free to ask me if you have any doubts regarding admission process, especially in Manipal Institutions.</p>
