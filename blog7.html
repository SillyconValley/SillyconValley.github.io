				    <p>India had always been considered a third-world country, a land of ‚Äúsnake charmers‚Äù as many like to call it so, but things started to change when our honourable Prime Minister, Narendra Modi started a campaign to digitize India a few years back. This led to emergence of many technological industries, companies and startups in India like Paytm. Even Reliance Industries got a boost after the launch of ‚ÄúJio‚Äù. Everything done in India is now getting online. You can now pay your bills, taxes, do shopping, purchase medicines, order food and what not just with a click of a button. This helped in bringing in FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) in India.
</p><br>

				    
				    <p>But that‚Äôs not the happy ending, path to success is never easy, right?. We never realized that a majority of the investments done in Indian companies were done by Chinese billionaires. Now, due to the recent war-like conditions between India and China, it was observed that India is one of the biggest markets of China in terms of goods, tech etc. The Chinese were preparing for a war against India and we, the Indians were paying for their weapons. Thus, it was concluded that we shouldn‚Äôt rely on other countries for their services, instead, we should start making our own goods and services. With this in mind, many Chinese apps like TikTok were banned in India. This small step was a success as now many Chinese companies like Tencent (owner of PUBG mobile game) have made special privacy policies for India and are going to store data of Indian users in India only. This will ensure the security of Indian citizens so that no one uses their data for threatening purposes.

					<p>COVID-19 created a negative image of China and now, India can use this in their advantage. Many tech giants are planning to shift their production from China to India. These tech companies include Apple, Samsung, Tesla etc. Even Google is planning to invest $10 billion in the Indian market in coming years.
This will help a lot as thousands of jobs will be created. Along with that, prices of products will decrease drastically. For example, prices of the ‚Äúluxury‚Äù phones for Indian people i.e. iPhones will reduce as the government imposes 20% tax on their imports which will be removed once the production starts. Thus, iPhones will be made available at affordable prices in India (finally!üòå). 

</p><br>

					<p>According to NEP (New Education Policy 2020), top foreign universities will be able to set up campuses in India and vice-versa. This is a great step as many Indians who go abroad to study and settle there can now get that same level of education in India and thus, provide services to Indian sectors, rather than working for other countries. This will also increase the level of research done in India and thus create new opportunities for students.</p>
<p>
All these steps and policies might take some time to implement, but once implemented, India will become a hub of knowledge and growth and maybe, the place where the next Apple or Google is made by the Indians, for the World!
